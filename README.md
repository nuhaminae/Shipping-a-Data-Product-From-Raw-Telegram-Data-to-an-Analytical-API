# Shipping a Data Product From Raw Telegram Data to an Analytical API

1. What are the top 10 most frequently mentioned medical products or drugs across all channels?
2. How does the price or availability of a specific product vary across different channels?
3. Which channels have the most visual content (e.g., images of pills vs. creams)?
4. What are the daily and weekly trends in posting volume for health-related topics?

This project involves scraping, data modeling, object detection with YOLO to enrich the data, and exposing the final insights through an analytical API.
